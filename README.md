## To run locally 

1. Make sure you have ruby-dev, bundler, and nodejs installed: `sudo apt install ruby-dev ruby-bundler nodejs`
2. Run `bundle clean` to clean up the directory (no need to run `--force`)
3. Run `bundle install` to install ruby dependencies. If you get errors, delete Gemfile.lock and try again.
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll liveserve` to generate the HTML and serve it from `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change.
