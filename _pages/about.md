I am currently a software enginee in Moqi, which is a company researching in biometrics.

I was employed by Orbbec as a software enginee, which is a company researching in 3D sensing.

I received my Master's degree in the school of computer science, NorthWestern Polytechnical University(NWPU), Xi'an, China , under the supervision of [Prof. WeiWei](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Wei-Wei-2148714604) and    [Prof. ZhangLei](https://sites.google.com/site/leizhanghyperspectral/home).

I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in the school of computer science, NorthWestern Polytechnical University(NWPU), Xi'an, China.

Research

======
My research intersets mainly lie in machine learning, especial in deep learning and computer vision, but also in traditional methods.

Indeed, my works focus on hyperspectral image processing, the field of insufficient and missing labels, in semi-supervised learning and few-shot learning. 

Right now, I'm working on a biometric-related field.
