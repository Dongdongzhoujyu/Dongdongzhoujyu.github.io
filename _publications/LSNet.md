Abstract:
Deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in sleep stage classification tasks, which starts to pave the way for potential real-world applications. However, due to its enormous size, deployment of deep neural networks is hindered by high cost at various aspects, such as computation power, storage, network bandwidth, power consumption, and hardware complexity. For further practical applications (e.g., wearable sleep monitoring devices), there is a need for simple and compact models. In this paper, we propose a lightweight model, namely LightSleepNet, for rapid sleep stage classification based on spectrograms. Our model is assembled by a much fewer number of model parameters compared to existing ones. Furthermore, we convert the raw EEG data into spectrograms to speed up the training process. We evaluate the model performance on several public sleep datasets with different characteristics. Experimental results show that our lightweight model using spectrogram as input can achieve comparable overall accuracy and Cohenâ€™s kappa (SHHS100: 86.7%-81.3%, Sleep-EDF: 83.7%-77.5%, Sleep-EDF-v1: 88.3%-84.5%) compared to the state-of-the-art methods on experimental datasets.
