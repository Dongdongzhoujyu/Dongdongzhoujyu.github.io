Abstract:
Accurate sleep stage classification is vital to assess sleep quality and diagnose sleep disorders. Numerous deep learning based models have been designed for accomplishing this labor automatically. However, the class imbalance problem existing in polysomnography (PSG) datasets has been barely investigated in previous studies, which is one of the most challenging obstacles for the real-world sleep staging application. To address this issue, this paper proposes novel methods with signal-driven and image-driven ways of noise addition to balance the imbalanced relationship in the training dataset samples. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods which are integrated into a convolutional neural network (CNN) based model. Experimental results evaluated on Sleep-EDF-V1, Sleep-EDF and CCSHS databases demonstrate that the proposed balancing approaches with specific tensity Gaussian white noise could enhance the overall or stage N1 recognition to some degree, especially the combination of two types of Data augmentation (DA) strategies shows the superiority of overall accuracy improvement.
