Abstract:
The aim of the study was to investigate whether the slow component of oxygen uptake was concurrent with the recruitment of large α-motoneuron muscle fibres by using wavelet and principal component analysis (PCA) of electromyography (EMG) during heavy and severe cycling exercise. Eleven male subjects participated in the study. After establishing each subject’s maximum value of oxygen uptake through an incremental test on the cycle ergometer, the subjects performed 6-min cycling tests at heavy and severe intensity. EMG signals were collected from rectus femoris, biceps femoris long head, tibialis anterior, and medial gastrocnemius and processed by combined use of wavelet and PCA analysis. The time delays to the onset of slow component occurred significantly earlier during severe (105.22 ± 5.45 s) compared with during heavy (138.78 ± 15.09 s) exercise. ANOVA with repeated measures showed that for all muscles tested, the angle θ formed by the first and second principal components decreased significantly between time windows during heavy and severe exercise. However, significant increases of EMG mean power frequency (MPF) were found only during heavy exercise. Our results show the concurrence of the oxygen uptake slow component with the additional recruitment of muscle fibres, presumably less efficient large α-motoneuron fibres.
